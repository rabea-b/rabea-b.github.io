Hi everyone! I studied psychology in Braunschweig, Germany (B.Sc.) and Lund, Sweden (M.Sc) and am currently a PhD candidate at Bielefeld University, Germany. From 2021 to 2024, I joined the work- and organizational psychology group in Bielefeld to work in the "iAtA"-research project. In my PhD research I focus on the use and design of immersive technologies, particularly Augmented Reality (AR) / Extended Reality (XR), for learning. Beyond this, my research interests lie in the fields of technology acceptance at work and in medicine, as well as age discriminatory experiences of young employees.
